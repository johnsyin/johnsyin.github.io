Hi! I am John. I am a person who loves writing/reading concise texts.  To read more about me, click [here](../about/).
### What is this place for?  
I have always been thinking about recording my life, projects, etc.   
  
_I have even been looking for ways to do "lifelogging" in a systematic way with the lowest cost (may be my future project)_
  
  
I will be mainly recording my personal projects about data/technology here (will it be part of my portfolio/freelancer profile? Hopefully).  
  
I probably will write awful English or do terrible projects, but that is not gonna stop me from starting this blog.
