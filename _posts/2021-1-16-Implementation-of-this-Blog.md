title: Implementation of this Blog
---

The implementation of this blog is fairly simple. I utilized Github Pages to host a static page, and the static page is generated using Jekyll.  
  
First, fork a repo called [jekyll now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on github.  
  
Then, the rest is just modifying config & add posts on your github (without codes/CLI). All these are guided properly on the repo as well.  
  
I did make some modification for my personal preference, but that's totally optional.  
  
That said, the repo is not maintained anymore but it does serve its purpose perfectly in a minimal manner.
