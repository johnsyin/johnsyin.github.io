title: Implementation of this Blog
---

The implementation of this blog is fairly simple, just by forking a repo called jekyll now on github.  
  
Then, the rest is just modifying config & add posts on your github (without codes/CLI). All these are guided properly on the repo as well.  
  
I did make some modification for my personal preference, but that's totally optional.  
  
That said, the repo is not maintained anymore tho it does serve its purpose perfectly in a concise manner.
