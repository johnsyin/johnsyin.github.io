Hi! Checkout who I am:
- A full-time Data Scientist
- A part-time AI researcher
- A Game Dev hobbyist
- A night owl
- Someone that likes bullet points a lot
Who I am not:
- Someone that reads/writes a lot
- Someone that writes perfect English

I love spending my leisure time to work on random projects. While they are not necessary data science, but mostly solving real(my) world(funny) problems with technology. In 2021, I decided to start writing them down in this place.
